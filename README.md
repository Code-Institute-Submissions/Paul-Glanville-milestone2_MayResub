## Purpose of project
The purpose with the creation of the project is to create a memory game with 16 Tiles from 1 - 16 and number as such. 
The finished product should allow the user to view a sequence with increasing difficulty levels as the user succeeds with each win of a round.
after a sequence is played the user will then be required to click on the same tiles in the sequence presented for each round.


---

## Function

### Star Button - when clicked will start the game at level 1 and run a sequnce, once clicked
### Tiles/ Numbered Boxes - should light up in sequence after a few seconds once the start button has been clicked, and once the sequence to each round has played the user is then to click on each tile in the order in which they have seen and can remember for that specific round/level.
### Round Counter - Displays each level/Round that the user is currently on  but will refresh to 1 if the user does not successfully click the tiles in order.
### dialogue box to display either the success or failure of each round. (in progress for the time being, will be included at later time.)

## User Stories

## Testing
while creating and testing the product there was an ongoing issue where it would not run and could not figure out the issue,
the start button and round display would show on the left side of the screen when viewing the product.

while testing the project, had a continuous problem i had struggled to solve, the first problem was getting the start button to place a sequence, but that now works and runs a random sequnce with increasing tiles on each level.
The second issue i have been facing is the tiles not lighting up upon being clicked therefore no comparison sequnce can be made as the tiles do not light up and it does not recognise the tile is being clicked.

### Credit

Excellence mentor - for advice and guidance with the language of javascript and direction of the project, also provided a block of javascript in game.js that i had taken inspiration of and personalised in index.js and helped with javascript for the reset and lighting up of tiles when clicked successfully and in error of sequence.

Code Institute material for refencing and material provided for the learning of functions and content.

https://coolors.co/palettes/trending - I used this site to get an idea on which colours would go well with each other, this had been presented by my mentor as a good way to test which colours would comliment and work well with others.
